// In programming languages like Java, the key difference between primitive data types and non-primitive (or reference) data types lies in how they store and manage data.

// Primitive Data Types:

// These are basic data types that are directly supported by the programming language.
// They are simple and atomic, representing single values.

// Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and are usually very efficient in terms of memory usage.

// Examples of primitive data types in Java include int, float, char, boolean, etc.


// Non-primitive Data Types:

// Also known as reference types, these are more complex data types that are not defined by the programming language itself but are built using primitive data types.
// They include objects, arrays, and other data structures.

// Non-primitive data types do not store the actual data; instead, they store a reference (memory address) to the location where the data is stored.

// They can have methods (functions) associated with them and provide more functionalities compared to primitive types.

// Examples of non-primitive data types in Java include classes, interfaces, arrays, etc.
// In summary, the main distinction is that primitive data types are simple, directly store values, and are more memory-efficient, while non-primitive data types are more complex, store references to data, and often come with additional functionality. Understanding the difference is essential for effective programming and memory management in a language like Java.


// here are some examples of Java primitive data types along with one example for each and their respective storage sizes:

// int:

// Example:
 int age = 25;
// Storage Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)

// float:

// Example:
 float temperature = 98.6f;
// Storage Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
// char:

// Example:
 char grade = 'A';
// Storage Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
// boolean:

// Example:
 boolean isJavaFun = true;
// Storage Size: Not precisely defined, typically implementation-dependent.

// double:

// Example:
 double salary = 50000.50;
// Storage Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
// byte:

// Example: 
byte numEmployees = 127;
// Storage Size: 1 byte (8 bits)
// short:

// Example:
 short distance = 1000;
// Storage Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
// long:

// Example:
 long population = 1500000000L;
// Storage Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
